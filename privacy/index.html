            <h2 class="fresh-panel-heading">FreshTeam Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We take privacy seriously. This includes having a straightforward privacy policy written in easy-to-understand language, not legalese. If you read nothing else, read these 10 key points about the data we collect and how we use it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It’s your data! What our customers store and do in FreshTeam is their data, not ours.  We are the custodian of this data. We are not the owners.</li>
                <li>We never sell or rent your data to third parties.</li>
                <li>We never “mine” the content you post to FreshTeam to target ads to you, on our service or anywhere else.</li>
                <li>Your FreshTeam chat history is private to you and the person you chat with. Your FreshTeam group history is private to the group’s members. A group’s creator or administrator(s) may change the group’s members.  You can block any individual member anytime you like.</li>
                <li>FreshTeam staff does not access or disclose your data unless we are compelled to by law or we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of FreshTeam, third parties or the public at large.</li>
                <li>FreshTeam collects and automatically displays the following data to your FreshTeam connections: your profile name; a profile photo should you have posted one; your current geolocation and “mode of transit” status (e.g., car, foot, train) should you have consented to provide it; and your status (online, busy, away, offline).  If another FreshTeam user connects to or adds you, they see only your name, profile photo and online status. You must consent to sharing your location with a person or group before they can see your location or mode of transit. You can turn location and mode of transit sharing off at any time, for all contacts you have consented to share it with or a specific contact. Our goal is to put you in complete control of location and transit sharing.</li>
                <li>We believe transparent teams are highly productive teams.  Your FreshTeam connections see what FreshTeam group you are presently viewing in the event they too have access to that specific FreshTeam room. Your FreshTeam connections see whether you are on a FreshTeam audio or video call. On the other hand, your FreshTeam connections do not see what FreshTeam group you are presently viewing if they do not have access to that FreshTeam room.  Only users you enable to see your location and mode of transit see this information. You can turn off sharing with a user or all users anytime. Location and mode of transit information are accurate to the best of our ability, meaning they rely on GPS and the sensors in your phone. Thus, from time to time, we may not reveal location or mode of transition with exact precision.</li>
                <li>You may be connected to FreshTeam users from your team automatically, depending on your team’s FreshTeam settings.</li>
                <li>We use service management and measurement tools to deliver and manage your FreshTeam service. This includes tools that help us aggregate usage of FreshTeam, so we can do things like plan for capacity or publish how many users overall rely on FreshTeam. These tools do not track the content you share in FreshTeam.</li>
                <li>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@fresh.team">support@fresh.team</a> or Privacy Administrator, Fresh Labs, Inc., 424 West 33rd St, Suite 410, New York NY 10001.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The following sections detail how we live up to the promise of these 10 key points. The terms “FreshTeam,” “we,” “us”, and “our” refer to Fresh Labs, Inc. the company; FreshTeam, the downloadable application for your smartphone or tablet; and FreshTeam, the corporate web site available at <a href="../index.html">www.fresh.team</a>.</p>
            <h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3>
            <p>The information that FreshTeam gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our service to confirm their email address. Those who engage in transactions with FreshTeam – by purchasing access to the service for themselves or their team – are asked to provide additional information, including personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, FreshTeam collects such information as is appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with FreshTeam. </p>
            <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
            <p>Through cookies or third-party tools, FreshTeam may collect non-personally identifiable statistics about the behavior of its customers to improve our services. These disclosures do not describe or identify any individual user. An example is a report examining how many users in aggregate adopt a new FreshTeam feature.</p>
            <P>We may also disclose non-personally identifiable aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in our products. These disclosures do not describe or identify any individual user. An example is publishing the total number of FreshTeam’s users.</P>
            <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>FreshTeam discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on FreshTeam’s behalf or to provide services available in FreshTeam’s products and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others unless legally required to do so.</p>
            <p>Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. By using FreshTeam’s products, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. FreshTeam will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>
            <p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, FreshTeam discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request; by written request of a user’s FreshTeam team administrator; or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of FreshTeam, third parties or the public at large.</p>
            <h3>Rights to Opt Out</h3>
            <p>If you are a registered user of a FreshTeam product and have supplied your email address, FreshTeam may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with FreshTeam and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.</p>
            <p>You may opt out of FreshTeam's marketing e-mails any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the email you receive.</p>
            <p>We may also send “transactional” email alerts in connection with your FreshTeam account’s activity. An example is an alert about important information a FreshTeam connection posted for you, or a connection adding you to a new FreshTeam group. You may opt out of FreshTeam's transactional e-mails any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the email you receive.</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a web site stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the web site each time the visitor returns. FreshTeam may use cookies to help FreshTeam identify and track visitors, their usage of the FreshTeam web site, and their web site access preferences. FreshTeam visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using FreshTeam’s web site, with the drawback that certain features of FreshTeam’s web site may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
            <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>If FreshTeam, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that FreshTeam goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of FreshTeam may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
            <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, FreshTeam may change its Privacy Policy from time to time and in FreshTeam’s sole discretion. FreshTeam encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the FreshTeam site or products after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
            <h3>Your Access and Correction Rights</h3>
            <p>If you choose to provide personal information to FreshTeam, we will provide you with the ability to access, correct, update, or delete the personal information you have provided. You can do this by logging in to your account using the username and password and editing your account profile, or by contacting support@fresh.team. You are responsible for maintain the accuracy and security of your own username and password, and FreshTeam is not responsible or liable for this.</p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>FreshTeam uses industry-standard physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your data. We also use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to transmit sensitive information. While FreshTeam endeavors to protect the security and integrity of the data you provide on our service, FreshTeam can make no guarantees about the security and integrity of your data. No electronic transmission or digital storage is ever fully secure or error free.</p>
            <p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, you consent to our use of email as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please contact us at support@fresh.team with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>
            <h3>Children’s Information</h3>
            <p>FreshTeam is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have received personal information from a visitor under the age of 13, we will delete the information from our records.</p>
